## Part 1: App Description

> Please provide a firendly description of your app, including the app

> of the app.

I have chose to work on an arcade game. Which is a classic minesweeper game,
the game has only one mouseclick event which is open up a mine.
When all mine is reveal except the one with bombs, the game is won and will restart
itself with proper notice.
If a bomb is clicked, the game is lost and will restart itself with proper notice.

## Part 2: New

To implement a game logic to a javafx project is exciting. Changing the scene to reset
the game is also one of the new topics i found interesting

## Part 3: Retrospect

I would like to try a game with more movement, so that i can utilize the use of timeline.
